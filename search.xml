<h3 id="Origin"><a href="#Origin" class="headerlink" title="Origin"></a>Origin</h3><p>My interest in acoustics began with a <a class="link"   href="https://www.ted.com/talks/evan_grant_making_sound_visible_through_cymatics?subtitle=en&trigger=30s" >TED talk<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> I watched during middle or high school (couldn’t find the browsing history, but I guess it was around Grade 10). In this talk, a creative technologist introduced how sound can be visualized by vibrating a medium such as sand and water. The demo looked so cool and visually appealing. The term “cymatics” was new to me, and it sparked my curiosity to delve deeper into the world of acoustics.</p>

<h3 id="Searching"><a href="#Searching" class="headerlink" title="Searching"></a>Searching</h3><p>At some point, when I was thinking about what major to study, I began searching for programs related to cymatics and acoustics. I could only check my emails to track my inquiries. Due to personal reasons, I decided to pursue my undergraduate studies in Canada. In November 2016, I emailed a university but didn’t mention acoustics, so I’m unsure if that was related. The first email I found mentioning acoustics was sent in March 2017. It looks quite naive in hindsight… 😂</p>

<p>I sent inquiries to various universities, companies (like <a class="link"   href="https://www.head-acoustics.com/" >HEAD acoustics<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.abdengineering.com/" >ABD engineering<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a><!--Melinda Miller-->), and organizations (like <a class="link"   href="https://caa-aca.ca/" >CAA<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="http://english.ioa.cas.cn/" >IOA of CAS<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>). Fortunately, many of them replied, with some providing detailed explanations and forwarding my queries to others. I felt so grateful for their help. I might not have remembered these experiences if I hadn’t reviewed my emails. I also sent some DMs on zhihu.com and received responses, which was helpful.</p>
<p>I wanted to study acoustics at the undergraduate level, but I could not find a specific program in Canada. There was one at the University of Sherbrooke, but since I don’t speak French, I could not apply. Based on my search and the feedback I received, I decided to apply for mechanical engineering and physics, and eventually chose to study physics.</p>
<h3 id="Learning"><a href="#Learning" class="headerlink" title="Learning"></a>Learning</h3><p>I started my undergraduate studies in September 2018. I somehow found the <a class="link"   href="https://www.mcgill.ca/music/programs/minor/mat" >MAT (Musical Applications of Technology)<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.mcgill.ca/music/programs/minor/mst" >MST (Musical Science &amp; Technology)<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> minor programs. According to my email records, I inquired about relevant courses in December 2018. And in October 2019, a master student (the mentor<!--Sabrina Berger--> I had in our physics program) told me I might be interested in the <a class="link"   href="https://www.cirmmt.org/en/welcome-to-cirmmt" >CIRMMT<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> center at our school. Then in February 2020, I applied for the MAT and was convinced to take MST instead. I got accepted. Although not all courses or assignments captured my interest, overall, it was a very good program. The professors were very dedicated.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>The email I found asking about the MAT/MST minor programs</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt;Subject: Questions about minors</span><br><span class="line">&gt;Date: December 5, 2018</span><br><span class="line">&gt;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;Hello Music department of McGill:</span><br><span class="line">&gt;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;I am currently a U0 Science student in McGill and interested in minoring Musical Applications of Technology or Musical Science and Technology.

And is there any course good to take for these two minors in my first year (such as COMP 202)? Also, is there any requirement about musical instruments skills (since I can’t play any)?</span><br><span class="line">&gt;</span><br><span class="line">&gt;Sincerely,</span><br><span class="line">&gt;Carrie Cheng</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Also in February 2020, through the <a class="link"   href="https://myalumni.mcgill.ca/s/1762/gid2/interior-getinvolved.aspx?sid=1762&gid=2&pgid=2022" >Job Shadowing Program<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>, I connected with an alumnus working at a local <a class="link"   href="https://www.softdb.com/" >acoustical consulting firm<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. I visited him and his workplace. He holds a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, and most of his colleagues were PhDs, some Masters, and an undergraduate intern. Through communication with him and his colleagues, I was impressed by their work, their passion, and their expertise. I might have thought: I hope I can be one of them. Perhaps it was around this time I realized I needed to pursue further studies.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><figcaption><span>Excerpt from one of my statements for a master's application.</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Through communicating with alumni working in Soft dB (an acoustical consulting and instruments company in Canada), I see how the knowledge of sound and vibrations I learned from schools is applied in their day-to-day work: they help people to create a more comfortable workplace by analyzing the noise in construction sites and using sound masking systems to reduce the noise level in the office. </span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Just like how I applied for undergraduate programs in high school, I continued searching for master’s programs in my third or fourth year. I consulted some of my professors and even reached out to an expert (also an alumnus) on LinkedIn. I found there are many programs in Europe (relatively). Plus, due to another <a href="../../../../2024/07/03/handpan-00/">personal interest</a>, I decided to move to Sweden to study <a class="link"   href="http://www.ta.chalmers.se/education/master-sound-vibration/" >Sound and Vibration<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Since arriving in Sweden, I’ve felt very fortunate. All the courses align with my interests, and everyone is incredibly friendly — the professors, classmates, and alumni. We support each other like a big family. Sometimes I wonder whether I enjoy physics and acoustics or just the company of the wonderful people I’ve met. I think it’s a bit of both.</p>
<h3 id="Looking-Back-Future"><a href="#Looking-Back-Future" class="headerlink" title="Looking Back &amp; Future"></a>Looking Back &amp; Future</h3><p>When people ask me why I study physics or acoustics, I often say it’s because of its interdisciplinary nature. To be honest, I don’t have a clear answer. Perhaps it was because I was deeply attracted by the beauty of sound visualization from that TED talk video, or maybe it was not a common choice, or I didn’t have the time to explore the beauty of other subjects. Sound is so closely related to our daily lives, and we experience it consciously and unconsciously every day. I’ve asked this question to my classmates as well. Some people say it sounds cool to study physics, some say they don’t like other subjects, and most of them cite personal interest and passion. If not for proactive learning, many people might not even be aware of the existence of acoustics as a subject.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, acoustics is a subset of physics and can be applied in various fields like engineering, psychology, music, and many more. If I could start over, would I still choose to study physics and acoustics? For now, I think so. I do like other subjects like liberal arts, but I cannot imagine myself studying them day after day or making a living out of it. (But, if I had unlimited time and resources, I would love to learn more about all different subjects.) I appreciate writers and artists and admire those who excel in their fields, but I know I am not one of them.</p>
<p>I remember writing in some of my master’s program application statements about how scholars like <a class="link"   href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/people/thomas-rossing" >Thomas Rossing<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> helped in the development of the <a class="link"   href="https://panart.ch/files/documents/PANArt_Buch_FR_110522.pdf" >Hang®<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> by contributing to the tuning techniques (ref: <a class="link"   href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/culture/life-changing-a-chimera-or-just-a-drum/38515012" >Life-changing, a chimera or just a drum?<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>), a musical instrument, that allows us to hear such extraordinary sounds. This synergy between art and science fascinates me. Acoustics is such a field. It spans a wide range of applications. It is simple yet complex. It is ancient yet innovative. As science and technology advance and as people pay more attention to their sensory experiences and seek a sustainable environment, I believe research in acoustics will continue to flourish. I have only scratched the surface, and there is so much more to explore.</p>

It consists of two hemispherical shells of nitrided or stainless steel. I was amazed by its extraordinary sound when I first listened to its music piece. When I dived into its history, I found it was created with the help of Professor Thomas Rossing, a physicist with a significant contribution in musical acoustics (also one of the authors of The Science of Sound, the leading textbook in the field as I mentioned). He and his colleagues studied the vibration modes and sound radiation modes to improve the sound generated from the instrument, together with the manufacturers - this is where I see the beauty and significance of the collaboration between scholars and industrial musical instrument manufacturers. Without scientific research, it might not have been invented. I hope to study the acoustical properties of handpan-like instruments and...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h3 id="2016-First-Impression"><a href="#2016-First-Impression" class="headerlink" title="2016 - First Impression"></a>2016 - First Impression</h3><p>It all began with a TV series - yes, I enjoy watching TV 😄. In the summer of 2016, I was captivated by a unique “wok-like” musical instrument that appeared in <em><a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Be_a_Better_Man" >To Be a Better Man<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></em>. It sounded so beautiful, and I had never seen anything like it. I started searching online to figure out what it was. After reading some Q&amp;A posts, I discovered that the instrument is called <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_(instrument)" >Hang®<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>, from Switzerland. Due to copyright issues, other similar instruments are referred to as <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handpan" >Handpan<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. I can’t remember exactly how I stopped searching, but it definitely planted a seed in my mind.</p>

Around January 2021, while staying at home during the pandemic, I found myself watching videos of handpan performances again. This time, I delved deeper into it — I emailed <a class="link"   href="https://panart.ch/" >PANArt<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>, the creators of the Hang®. Unfortunately, “due to the pandemic and the restrictions”, I couldn’t visit them in Switzerland, so I joined a WeChat group for handpan enthusiasts in China. I received some advice but eventually decided to set the idea aside.</p>

Good things come in slow.</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">Regards and many thanks</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">David Rohner</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">PANArt has received your email expressing interest in our sound sculptures. Thank you very much.</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">After the Hang Sculpture, the Hang Gubal and the Hang Bal, the new instrument Hang Balu has also met with great interest and is already being actively explored by many hands. The tuning art of the PANArt tuners is based on the knowledge that only hammering the material -in our case the pang composite- leads to instruments that serve the human being to tune into life. So it is understandable that such works are not produced in large numbers. Since the beginnings of sound sculpting here in Bern, it has been clear to the PANArt tuners: mass production is not an option.</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">As you can see from our homepage, the range of Hang sound sculptures has changed a lot in recent years. New forms and concepts have emerged, all of which are intended to allow the players to create the sounding music freely in the moment. Beyond performance, pressure and virtuosity, they allow access for all interested persons. They are, so to speak, tools that help to realize the music that lies dormant within.</span><br><span class="line">A considerable number of sheet metal instruments, which are visually oriented towards the Hang and usually also violate PANArt AG rights, can be found in many places. We recommend that you inform yourself well about Hang and Handpan (plagiarisms of our Hang sculpture). </span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">From time to time we invite interested people to visit us in Bern to get to know the different Hanghang (plural of Hang). Feeling and playing these soundscapes is very important - each one is unique. Without obligation and in peace and quiet, you may immerse yourself in the world of Hang at our atelier. On these days it is also possible to choose a sound sculpture and take it with you.</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">We recommend that you explore the various possibilities in advance - listen and watch the different sound sculptures of the Hang brand on our homepage and our YouTube channel.</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">    · The Hang Balu enables a musical exchange in a collective, far away from expectations and pressure to perform. The instruments offer themselves as a common denominator, as a universal language to which everyone has access. When playing collectively, only a small contribution is needed from the individual player to create a complex web of sound - always carried by the pulse. The Hang Balu is the latest fruit of PANArt research. All the qualities of the previous Hanghang are found here again.</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">    · The Hang Bal play is a dance. The player becomes the instrument. The Hang Bal game gives the individual musical space on a common groove. Together, a round dance is created. Whoever has music inside will find a place here.</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">    · The Hang Sculpture is still built by PANArt for specific purposes. We also integrate its qualities in the new Hang Balu. This can be understood as a more grounded and refined successor to the Hang Sculpture.</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">You can find more information about the Hang sound sculptures on our homepage under the category &quot;Instruments&quot;.</span><br><span class="line">For a deeper insight into our work, we recommend reading our book &quot;Hang - sound sculpture&quot;. By reading this book the essential backgrounds and basics of our sound sculptures will unfold more easily for you. </span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">It is part of our business culture since many years that we demand the signature of an agreement between our customers and PANArt, where our customers declare to relinquish from speculation by reselling their instruments. You can find the prices of our sound sculptures below. Swiss taxes, a cleaning fluid, a backpack and a natural fiber shell (made in Germany) are always included.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">If you would like to travel to Bern on a visiting day to explore the PANG landscapes with your hands, please let us know with your full address. As soon as it is possible to receive visitors again, we will inform you about planned dates. However, due to the current situation with the corona virus, we have decided not to announce any visit days for the next few weeks - even the near future is difficult to plan for at the moment.  As longer travels should be avoided as much as possible at the moment, it is also possible to receive a sound sculpture by post. If you are interested, we recommend that you inform yourself well about the different Hanghang and consider the above-mentioned book.</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">With regards from Bern</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">The PANArt Team</span><br><span class="line">Sabina Schärer, Felix Rohner, Basil Rohner, David Rohner</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">PANArt Hangbau AG</span><br><span class="line">Engehaldenstr.131</span><br><span class="line">3012 Bern</span><br><span class="line">Switzerland</span><br><span class="line">www.panart.ch</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">The prices of the available instruments:</span><br><span class="line">Sound sculpture Hang® Bal, including a suitcase made of natural fibers and a carrying bag (made in Germany/Winter GmbH), cleaning fluid and 7.7% VAT CHF 2500        </span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">Sound sculpture Hang® Balu, including a suitcase made of natural fibers and a carrying bag (made in Germany/Winter GmbH), cleaning fluid and 7.7% VAT CHF 2500   </span><br><span class="line">Hang Balu Duo (Two Hang Balus, incl. a suitcase made of natural fibers and a carrying bag (made in Germany/Winter GmbH), cleaning fluid and 7.7% VAT) CHF 4500</span><br><span class="line">Hang Balu Set (Balu Sui, Balu Sai, Balu Sei, Hang Godo, incl. a suitcase made of natural fibers and a carrying bag (made in Germany/Winter GmbH), cleaning fluid and 7.7% VAT) CHF 6000</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">These instruments can be ordered online and will be sent:</span><br><span class="line">Hang® Balu Urgu including a suitcase made of natural fibers, back pack, cleaning fluid and 7.7% VAT CHF 770  </span><br><span class="line">Hang® Gudu including a suitcase made of natural fibers, cleaning fluid and 7.7% VAT CHF 540 </span><br><span class="line">Hang® Godo including a suitcase made of natural fibers, cleaning fluid and 7.7% VAT CHF 540 </span><br><span class="line">Hang® Gede including a soft bag and cleaning fluid and 7.7% VAT   CHF 230 </span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Later on, I thought about handpan from time to time, either passively or spontaneously. While pursuing a minor in <a class="link"   href="https://www.mcgill.ca/undergraduate-admissions/program/musical-science-and-technology" >Musical Science and Technology<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>, I incorporated Handpan-related elements into the final projects for <a href="https://carrieeex.github.io/MUMT306-project/">MUMT 306 - Fall 2021</a> and <a href="https://carrieeex.github.io/MUMT307-project/">MUMT 307 - Winter 2022</a>. Although working with handpan wasn’t my original intent — I prefer experiencing live music from real instruments — it still provided some inspiration.</p>

To some extent, it was because of Hang® and handpan. Soon after I arrived, I found a <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/FranzenInstruments/" >local handpan maker<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. I was so excited to see a handpan in real life! I immediately ordered one from him and bought a <a class="link"   href="https://book.douban.com/subject/35789412/" >course book<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> from China as well. Unfortunately, the production did not proceed as planned.</p>

<h3 id="2024-Learning"><a href="#2024-Learning" class="headerlink" title="2024 - Learning"></a>2024 - Learning</h3><p>Most of the time, I play my handpan casually, whenever I feel like it, rather than practice deliberately. One day, I somehow noticed that <a class="link"   href="https://www.manudelago.com/" >Manu Delago<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> would be performing in Vienna, Austria. I immediately decided to buy a ticket and go see <a class="link"   href="https://konzerthaus.at/concert/eventid/60991" >the concert<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>!</p>
<p>(Side note: Initially, I confused the concert venue with the Golden Hall, which made me even more excited to visit Vienna. Later, I found out from a friend that the concert was actually at a different venue - I had mixed up the <a class="link"   href="https://www.musikverein.at/en/" >Musikverein<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://konzerthaus.at/" >Konzerthaus<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. I also discovered that <a class="link"   href="https://www.langlangofficial.com/" >Lang Lang<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> was going to <a class="link"   href="https://www.musikverein.at/konzert/?id=0004e11e" >perform at the Golden Hall<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> on the same day as Manu’s concert. I really wish I had a clone to attend both concerts!)</p>
<p>During the intermission, I went to the front of the stage to look at the handpans Manu was playing and started a conversation with an audience member standing next to me. I asked him what Manu was saying during the performance (as I don’t understand German), and we ended up talking about Manu, handpan, and ourselves. He introduced himself as <a class="link"   href="https://andywinkler.com/" >Andy<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>, a composer, teacher, and handpan player. He invited me to his studio for a lesson. Everything was so unexpectedly wonderful!</p>
<p>Recently (at the end of June), while volunteering at a <a class="link"   href="https://aes2.org/event-extra/2024-aes-5th-international-conference-on-automotive-audio/" >conference<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>, I heard the sound of a handpan in the Immersive Audio room. Even before the video appeared, I instantly recognized the sound of the handpan due to its unique and beautiful tone. It was a live performance by <a class="link"   href="https://www.martinkaelberer.com/" >Martin Kälberer<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> mixed by <a class="link"   href="https://www.msm-studios.com/stefan-bock" >Stefan Bock<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Si on a beaucoup parlé de la présence de la chanson I follow rivers de Lykke Li, on sait moins de choses sur les musiques instrumentales qui habillent certaines scènes du film, notamment celle du premier regard échangé entre Adèle et Léa. L’instrument que l’on entend s’appelle un hang (ou hang drum).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Un jour par hasard, j’ai rencontré un musicien qui jouait d’un instrument qui avait un son très mélancolique et en le mettant dans la scène j’ai pensé que ça pourrait créer cette émotion forte pendant la rencontre. Je crois que la musique à ce moment-là participe de l’émotion dans la rencontre”, a expliqué Abdellatif Kechiche lors d’une conférence de presse au New York Film.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  <em>Google Translate: While much has been said about the presence of the song I follow rivers by Lykke Li , less is known about the instrumental music that adorns certain scenes in the film, notably that of the first glance exchanged between Adèle and Léa. The instrument that we hear is called a hang (or hang drum).</em></p>
<p>  <em>“One day by chance, I met a musician who played an instrument that had a very melancholic sound and by putting it in the scene I thought that it could create this strong emotion during the meeting. I believe that the music at that moment participates in the emotion in the meeting ,” explained Abdellatif Kechiche during a press conference at New York Film.</em></p>

<p>I’ve wanted to build my own website for a long time, a place to gather my experiences, thoughts, and life moments. A space where I can document the places I’ve been, the photos I’ve taken, the people I’ve met, and the things I’ve encountered. Think of it as a digital diary. But I never started. Now isn’t the best time to begin either, as I have more important things to do. Yet, I don’t feel like doing them. So here I am.</p>
<p>I don’t want to reveal too much about my personal life, but perhaps we are all already “naked” in this digital world. It’s challenging to focus solely on myself without mentioning family, friends, or others. I am well aware of my limited knowledge and abilities. I don’t know who, other than myself, would read or care about this. But even if it’s just for me, that’s enough.</p>
<p>I’ve forgotten many childhood experiences and can’t recall them. Without words, photos, videos, or memories, how can we bring back the past? I have no idea. Maybe I just want to leave something behind. This public website is a beginning; I hope it is not the end.</p>
